# Simple-Dashboard
This is a Simple Dashboard I created using Shiny and Shiny Dashboard Libraries. I've done this dashboard for Normal and Exponential Distribution.
# Chess Dashboard
This dashboard is created using Tableau where I have used a chess dataset to analyze how the moves are in the chess board towards the win or lose or draw in a game based on the moves provides.
It is quite a challenging dataset I tried my best to visualize it.

Below is the dashboard link.
